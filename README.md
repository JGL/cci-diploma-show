# CCI-Diploma-Show

The tiniest MMORPG. Choose an avatar and hang out with your friends while attending the end of year (2020) show for the [UAL Creative Computing Institute](https://www.arts.ac.uk/creative-computing-institute)'s [Diploma in Creative Computing](https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/creative-computing/undergraduate/ual-creative-computing-institute-diploma).

The project was based on an earlier project - [LIKELIKE Online](https://github.com/molleindustria/likelike-online) by [Molleindustria](http://molleindustria.org/).

You can mod it to create your own virtual exhibitions, multi-user environments or games.  
It's designed to be extensible by just editing the data.js file and a few settings at the beginning of server.js and client.js.

CCI-Diploma-Show was built with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [socket.io](https://socket.io/), [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), and the p5.js add-on [p5.play](https://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/).

## The .env file

.env is a text file in the root folder that contains private variables, in this case admin usernames and passwords and the port used by the project. It's not published on github and it's not automatically published on glitch so you may have to create it manually and/or copy paste the content in the glitch editor and/or in your code editor if you are running is as a local project.

An example of .env file for LIKELIKE online is:

```javascript
(ADMINS = adminname1 | pass1), adminname2 | pass2;
PORT = 3000;
```

The admin names are reserved. Logging in as "adminname|pass" (nickname and password separated by a "|") will grant the user admin priviledges such as banning IP or sending special messages.
